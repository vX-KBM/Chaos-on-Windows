# Chaos-on-Windows
This Python code changes all Windows Registry values in multiple threads... WARNING!!! - Your PC can become fully unstable or even the hardware can be damaged! Run it at your own risk, haven't tested it myself...

If someone can test it (on the potato PC ofc, that is not a much loss) and make a video from the phone and share it here, I would appreciate it!

No need to install dependencies, it does it automatically.
